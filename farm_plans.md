see Regenerative Agriculture page 83 of pdf to run personal values clarification exercise

create holistic context document with tom ( pg 85,86)

pg 89 = site data collection checklist... ask tom+robert if they have that info.

what are the legal structures related to the farm? What are the legal relationships between tom, me, robert, any corporations, etc? Who is final decision maker? What are goals for the property?

Onion notes:

> One of the more popular onions adapted for our area is the 1015Y or Texas SuperSweet onion, developed by Texas A&M for the Texas onion industry for disease resistance and good size. A bonus was the incredibly mild flavor of this onion. Home gardeners have reaped the benefits of A&Mâ€™s research since this is a great variety for backyard gardens. Other varieties for our area include Yellow and White Granex, White Bermuda (also called Crystal Wax), Grano 502 (literally mother of all the sweet onions) and Red Burgundy. Sweet Red and Cimarron are 2 popular intermediate types.
> Timing of onion planting is also important. Short day types are planted late January through mid-February, while intermediate types can be planted from early February through early March. (live seedlings)
> Mid to late October is the best time to plant seed of the super sweet, short-to-intermediate daylength onion types in Texas zones III - V (USDA Zones 8 and 9). Seeds can be sown directly into the garden, covered with one-fourth inch of soil and should sprout within 7- 10 days. If planted thickly, plants can be pulled and utilized as green onions or scallions for salads or fresh eating in 8-10 weeks. However, most gardeners want to grow an onion bulb as large as a basketball. To do this, the onion plants must be thinned by next February until they are at least 2-3 inches apart to insure adequate bulb expansion. The removed plants can be used for scallions or for transplanting into another area of the garden so that these too will have adequate space in which to enlarge into large bulbs.
> Fertilization of onion plants is vital to success. Texas A&M research findings indicate that onion growth and yield can be greatly enhanced by banding phosphorus 2-3 inches below seed at planting time. This phosphorus acts as a starter solution which invigorates the growth of young seedlings. Banding phosphorus, such as super phosphate (0-20-0), 2-3 inches below the seed involves making a trench 3 inches deep, distributing one-half cup of super phosphate per 10 row feet, covering the phosphate with soil, sowing seed and covering lightly with one-half inch or less of soil. Once established, onion plants should receive additional amounts of fertilizer (21-0-0 - Ammonium sulfate or Ammonium nitrate) as a side-dress application every month.
> Gardeners who tend to procrastinate should be warned that planting later than October could mean failure. Failure in onion production comes in two forms - - complete annihilation of the young seedlings during a cold winter or an abundance of spring onion flowers which decrease bulb size, weight and storage ability. Onion plants which are small and rapidly growing when the cold temperatures of winter arrive will probably not survive. Yet, if you plant earlier and the stem of onion plants are larger than a pencil when exposed to cold temperatures, the onion will initiate and produce a flower during the following spring. This flowering is termed bolting. Bolting requires low temperatures. Most rapid bolting is caused by temperatures of 40-45 degrees F. or below. Fall seeded crops are susceptible to bolting the following spring if warm fall temperatures, allowing excessive growth, are followed by low winter temperatures and slowed growth. Many gardeners believe that early removal of the onion flower stalk will cause onion bulb enlargement but this has not proven to be the case. Flowering causes a decrease in bulb size as well as a central flower stalk which enhances decay during storage. This is exactly what will happen to those who are planting onion transplants or sets in October or November with the hope of large onions next spring. The onion bulbs which produce a flower stalk may be large but they will be light-weight (one-half the weight of a comparable size, non-flowered onion bulb) and prone to decay. Obviously, what you see is not always what you get! The best way to insure success is to either plant the onion seed from October 1 until November 15 or plant transplants from January through February in Texas Zones III - V (USDA Zones 8 and 9).

Potato notes:

fall planting in hot southern states (texas) may be ideal to allow root system development
